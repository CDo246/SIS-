# Debot: Watch AI debate whatever you want!

This project was created during the "Software Innovation Studio" subject at the University of Technology Sydney

With this app, the user is able to input a topic to be debated such as:

- Is pineapple on pizza good?
- Should vaping be banned?

The application will then generate a classic For vs Against debate. Users can also set parameters such as message count and personalities from our provided presets.

The application utilizes the OpenAI API, using GPT-4 to create its outputs. A valid key with GPT-4 access must be provided in the .env file in order for the project to run as intended.
